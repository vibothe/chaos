#Create codes to visualize the simple deterministic equations leading to completely random results based on tiny deviation in starting condition.
#Why are we doing this?? Well, the plots look mesmerizing and because we can!!!

Some candidates :

1. Logistic equation to simulate population dynamics : try 2d and 3d too!

2. Lorentz Attractor (the butterfly pattern!)

3. Fractals : Mandelbrot set, Koch curve, Sierpinski triangle
